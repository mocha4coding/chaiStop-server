# About the project
I built this as project as my entry for Microsoft Engage FTE-2021. This is basically an online community for students. During the pandemic, the one thing we miss is hanging out with friends at chai-stalls where we used to have countless discussions on literally anything related to our college life , be it a college fest, normal academic doubts or may be just getting to know our batchmates . We all had our favourite chai-stalls close to our campuses. It is not possible to replicate those moments we create in a real life chai-stop virtually. But this community can act as an equally favorite socializing hub in the digital world.
